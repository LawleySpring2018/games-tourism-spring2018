## Course Catalog Description 
IGME-590: From “gamified” tours of locations to augmented reality games to board games based on specific locations, games are increasingly being used by the tourism and hospitality industry as tools to attract new visitors to locations, and engage tourists in activities. In this course, students will review research and case studies of games related to tourism. The class will include presentations by experts in tourism and hospitality as well as experienced game designers. Students will work individually and in groups to create and refine ideas for both analog and digital games related to tourism. 

IGME-580: This course will allow students to work as domain specialists on teams completing one or more large projects over the course of the semester.  The projects will be relevant to experiences of the Interactive Games and Media programs, but will require expertise in a variety of sub-domains, including web design and development, social computing, computer game development, multi-user media, human-computer interaction and streaming media. Students will learn to apply concepts of project management and scheduling, production roles and responsibilities, and their domain skill sets to multidisciplinary projects.  Students will complete design documents, progress reports and final assessments of themselves and their teammates in addition to completing their assigned responsibilities on the main projects

## Course Materials and Communication
There is no required textbook, but there will be required weekly readings; all readings will be linked from the [weekly topic schedule](Schedule.md). 

MyCourses will *only* be used for grading (and the occasional copyrighted reading), not for distribution of materials or communication. There will be links in myCourses pointing you to this Github repository and to our class Slack. 

## Course Organization
From 2-3:20 class will typically consist of a short lecture focused on the weekly topic, followed by an in-class activity, a guest lecture, or a site visit. During weeks 1 and 2, that will be extended into the 3:30-5pm time slot. 

Starting in week 3, the 3:30-5pm time slot will be used 

## [Course Topics & Schedule](Schedule.md)
The schedule of topics, readings, and exercises can be found in the [Schedule.md](Schedule.md) file. Materials for in-class exercises can be found in the Github folder for that week's class, and will be linked from the schedule.  It is your responsibility to check the schedule for each week's readings. You will find the in-class exercises very challenging if you do not complete the readings for that week. 

## Attendance
Because much of the class revolves around in-class activities, attendance is critical. If you miss a class, you should check Github and/or Slack for information on what was done, and contact me about options for making up the in-class work. If you know you'll be missing a class due to illness or a conflict, please let me know before class starts.  

## Grading
Your final grade for IGME-590 will be based on your individual assignments. Your final grade for IGME-580 will be based on your group game project. 

I give only three possible final grades in these classes. You'll receive a grade of A ("good work!"), C ("you passed, but your work was unimpressive"), or F ("you have not mastered this material"), based on your overall average for the class. Here's the breakdown:

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 83%-100%	| A |
| 65%-82.9%	| C |
| 0-64.9%	| F |

## Individual Assignments (IGME 590 Grade)

### Class Journal or Blog (40% of final grade)
Each week there will be lectures, readings, and in-class activities. You will be expected to maintain a journal in which you discuss the week's materials and activities--either as a Google Doc (with access granted to me), or as an entry on the class blog. You will receive a weekly grade on this, although the grades will only be posted every 2-3 weeks. 

### Attendance, In-Class Activities, & Class Participation (20% of final grade)
You are expected to attend class regularly, since there will be many guest lectures, site visits, and group activities that cannot be made up outside of class. 

### Game Analysis Paper (20% of final grade)
You will write a 5-7 game analysis of a tourism-focused game (or games), which will be due in week 7.

### Dubrovnik Game Opportunities Paper (20% of final grade)
You will write a 5-7 page paper identifying opportunities for games that would address challenges faced by either tourists or tourism providers in Dubrovnik.  

## Group Game Project (IGME 580 Grade)
Projects will be assessed twice; once at the end of week 7, and once at the end of the semester. 

### Midterm Assessment (30% of final grade)
I will assess your group's progress at the end of week 7. This assessment will include your pitches, proposals, ongoing documentation, and team communication and organization effectiveness.  I will include a peer evaluation component in this assessment. 

If you have created a prototype and/or performed a playtest, I will review that separately, and will use it to determine whether you should apply to pitch your game at the Reboot Develop conference. 

### Final Assessment (70% of final grade)
Your final assessment will include all prototypes and playtests, design documentation, team communication and effectiveness, and the final version of the game itself. I will include a peer evaluation component in this assessment, as well. 

	
## Additional Policies

### Important RIT Croatia Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is 22 January 2018.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of “W” is 6 April 2018.
- You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade. 

### Communication
Any updates to assignments or the syllabus will be posted in Github and automatically announced in Slack. Major announcements (such as class cancellations) will be posted in the general channel in Slack. This means you should regularly check the class Slack, and consider setting up notifications for the general channel. I check both email and Slack frequently, and will try to always respond within 24 hours (the exception to this is when I’m traveling, for which I’ll give you advance notice). You will get a faster response using Slack, with the bonus that other people in the class can help answer questions, as well. If you want to send me email, please make sure you send it from your RIT account to my primary RIT email: Elizabeth dot Lawley at rit dot edu. 
### Late Policy
If you are having problems with an assignment or have an emergency that may make you late in submitting your work, please contact me before the due date. Late assignments that have not been cleared with me before the due date may not be accepted, or may incur a grade penalty. 
### Missed Classes
If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to check with classmates for notes to supplement the materials I've already provided online. I will not recap classes for you. 
### Office Hours
I will have a minimum of four office hours per week. This is an excellent time to come in with questions on the course material, homework, or in class work. I am always happy to help you understand the course material or assignments—or just to chat about whatever topic you’d like. Take advantage of this time, since few students bother to talk with their professors outside of class. If for some reason I’m called away during office hours, there will be a note on the door. 
### Mobile Phones 
Please turn off sounds on your phone, so that you don’t disturb the people around you with notification noises. If you must take a call, please leave the room to do so. 
### Notices of Accommodation
If you have a “Notice of Accommodation”, I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met. 
### Social Networks
I don’t initiate friend requests on Facebook, because I don’t want you to feel obligated to accept. However, I do generally accept friend requests from students. I have a private Twitter account that I seldom use, and don’t accept follower requests on it. I maintain a LinkedIn account, and am happy to connect with students there in order to help them find job-related connections. Links to my various social media accounts can be found on my website (lawley.rit.edu). 
### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, and then only by prior arrangement with me. Note that I only give incompletes in the event of: 1) military deployment or 2) documented and verifiable family or personal illness/emergency. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework does not fall into either of those two categories. Please come see me ASAP if you’re having difficulty so we can find a solution together. 
### Academic Dishonesty
My policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an “F” as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.)

Please review RIT’s policy on academic integrity:
